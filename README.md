Using
-----

Hold the phone/tablet near the instrument, play a note, and observe the
display. In portrait, the app shows a scope with the input signal, a
spectrum showing the processed signal, the main display with the note
value, cents error, frequency error etc, a strobe display, and a meter
display showing the cents error. In landscape, the app shows just the
main display and the meter. There is a signal indicator in the action
bar which is useful in landscape mode.

Building
--------

To build the project, use:

    ./gradlew build
